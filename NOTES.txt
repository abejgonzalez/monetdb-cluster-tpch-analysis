How to profile
--------------
1. Dump all results from pystethoscope to a DB table
2. Use SQL queries to filter based on `module` and `function`
    a. Split things up by threads
    b. Use the `state` = `end` to get the `usec` in that mod/func (assume `start` `state` is 0 `usec`)

Can `tee` pystethoscope output
Can add EXPLAIN to front of query, or PLAN, to get more information

How to setup cluster (assuming N workers and 1 master)
--------------------
1. Have dbgen generate scaling factor split up into N workers
2. On each worker, start a server using mserver5 (and load the data in)
3. Link the tables back to the master (first create the remotes, then add the merges)

# TODO: Recreate the profiling dumps for each and do max/min calcs
#       Can you just sum on the threads? or do you take the max? Maybe determine this based on the total runtime?
#       Stop and restart DBfarm to check if the imtermediate files are removed
